# ASE2NX

A utility to convert Aseprite files to various ZX Spectrum Next formats including sprites, fonts, maps, and Layer 2 graphics. This tool is a more generic evolution from the one specifically designed for development of [Next Point](https://github.com/vmorilla/next-point).

## Overview

ASE2NEXT processes Aseprite (.ase/.aseprite) files and converts them to formats compatible with ZX Spectrum Next development:

- **Sprites**: Converts Aseprite layers to Next hardware sprites
- **Fonts**: Extracts character sets from tilesets for text display
- **Maps**: Converts tilemaps to binary formats usable in Next games
- **Layer 2 Graphics**: Converts image data to Layer 2 format
